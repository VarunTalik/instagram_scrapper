Instagram Bot

I wrote this script when I found out that we get user details bundled up in a <script> tag. This bot reads a list of instagram usernames from your local file and retrieves the user details viz. id, followers, posts etc and dumps it into a CSV file. Thus you can use this script in case you do not want to use instagram APIs.
